# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased] - TBD

### Removed

- stac_api_version is no longer field in the root catalog. This was removed from the
  STAC API spec several versions ago, in favor of the conformance classes.
- STAC_API_VERSION environment variable is no longer supported. The version is now hard-coded
  to 1.0.0-rc.2

### Added

- (Experimental) Aggregation Extension endpoint /aggregate
- Added pre-hook and post-hook Lambda examples
- POST /collections endpoint to create collections

### Changed

- Landing Page (root) now has links for both GET and POST methods of search link relation
- The STAC API version is now 1.0.0-rc.2
- AWS OpenSearch Service OpenSearch 2.3 is used as the default instead of Elasticsearch 7.10.
  See [migration section in README.md](README.md#04x---05x).
- The serverless.example.yml file now has zone awareness enabled and an even number of
  Elasticsearch nodes
- Upgrade serverless to 3.x
- Remove use of serverless-psuedo-parameters
- Upgrade to Node 16

## [0.4.1] - 2022-07-11

### Added

- Added proper value for 'collections' parameter in the next page link in the result of a GET request
- Added mappings for 'id' and 'collection' for default sort keys
- Added STAC_API_VERSION as an environment variable to the serverless.yml file
- Added STAC_API_VERSION to display on the API landing page within the api.js file under src/lib/api.js in the collectionsToCatalogLinks function
- Add support for pre- and post-hooks

### Changed

- Modified sortby and collections parameters in nextlink
- Used map instead of foreach/push in api.js file
- Changed the rel type to 'server' for the URL to the STAC API webpage inside the Links object
- Modified sortby and collections parameters in nextlink
- Used map instead of foreach/push in api.js file
- Compression of responses is now handled by API Gateway and not Express. This means that the _uncompressed_ response from stac-server [must be less than 6 MB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.html#function-configuration-deployment-and-execution).

### Removed

- Removed the failed-ingest Lambda function from the serverless.yml file since this function is no longer needed
- Deleted failed-ingest folder from the src/lambdas directory

## [0.4.0] - 2022-04-19

### Added

- Add conformance classes for `STAC API - Features` and `STAC API - Collections`. Both were already fully-supported, but
  were not advertised in the landing page conformsTo attribute or the /conformance endpoint.
- Items larger than 256 KB can now be ingested by writing their contents to S3
- API responses are now compressed
- Transaction Extension is now implemented
- Landing Page link relation service-doc now exists, and points to a Redoc instance
- If a request includes the `X-STAC-Endpoint` header, that endpoint will be used when generating link hrefs

### Fixed

- Open-ended datetime intervals using either empty string or '..' now work
- Correct content types are now returned
- Searching for a nonexistent collection returns empty results
- Re-ingesting an Item maintains the existing value of properties.created and sets properties.updated to now
- Fixes the responses from `/collections/{collectionId}`, `/collections/{collectionId}/items`, and `/collection/{collectionId}/items/{itemId}`.
- Search limit parameter is now validated to be between 1 and 10000 inclusive
- Search datetime parameter is now strictly validated as a RFC 3339 datetime or interval of two datetimes
- Added `root` link relation to Landing Page (`/`)
- GET /search only accepts a bbox value of a comma-separated string and POST /search
  only accepts a bbox array of numbers. Previously, both methods accepted both formats in
  violation of the STAC API spec.

### Changed

- Upgrade to Node 14
- Elasticsearch version update 7.9 -> 7.10
- Use Express for API routing
- Item and collection ingest operations will full replace an item with the same ID. Previously, partial-updates were being performed.
- Improvements to Elasticsearch field mappings
- PATCH /collections/:collectionId/items/:itemId now returns 204 No Content as succcess instead
  of 200 and the updated Item
- Default sortby is now guaranteed to be stable. Previously, it was only by `properties.datetime`, not it is
  by `properties.datetime`, `id`, and `collection`.
- ItemCollection results no longer have a `prev` link relation. This is a by-product of changing
  pagination to use Elasticsearch's more performant `search_after` mechanism rather than `page`
- Pagination works past 10,000 items now
- An invalid search `intersects` parameter may sometimes return a 500 instead of a 400 status code.

### Removed

- Querying Items in a Collection by POST to /collections/:collectionId/items is
  no longer supported, as this is forbidden by the STAC API - Features
  conformance class because it conflicts with the Transaction Extension

## [0.3.1] - 2021-07-28

### Fixed

- Root catalog now properly includes `type: Catalog`

## [0.3.0] - 2021-07-06

### Added

### Fixed

- Array GET parameters can now be comma-delimited, as per spec
- Collections link rel type changed to `data`
- Added required rel=search links in root
- Geometry now properly being serialized
- Multiple security vulnerability updaets in dependent libraries
- Integration tests

### Changed

- Elasticsearch version update 6.8 -> 7.9
- Updated all mappings
- Enforce only HTTPS access
- Migrate base configuration from t2.small -> t3.small instances
- Updated integration tests to use more update STAC 1.0.0 spec
- Some fields, such as assets and links, are now excluded from indexing
- Enforce https
- Increase SQS VisibilityTimeout and Ingest Lambda timeout

### Removed

- Mapping types (deprecated in Elasticsearch)

## [0.2.1] - 2020-12-14

### Fixed

### Added

### Changed
