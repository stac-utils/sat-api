All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add conformance classes for `STAC API - Features` and `STAC API - Collections`. Both were already fully-supported, but
  were not advertised in the landing page conformsTo attribute or the /conformance endpoint.
- Items larger than 256 KB can now be ingested by writing their contents to S3
- API responses are now compressed
- Transaction Extension is now implemented

### Fixed

- Open-ended datetime intervals using either empty string or '..' now work
- Correct content types are now returned
- Searching for a nonexistent collection returns empty results
- Re-ingesting an Item maintains the existing value of properties.created and sets properties.updated to now
- Fixes the responses from `/collections/{collectionId}`, `/collections/{collectionId}/items`, and `/collection/{collectionId}/items/{itemId}`.
- Search limit parameter is now validated to be between 1 and 10000 inclusive
- Search datetime parameter is now strictly validated as a RFC 3339 datetime or interval of two datetimes
- Added `root` link relation to Landing Page (`/`)
- GET /search only accepts a bbox value of a comma-separated string and POST /search
  only accepts a bbox array of numbers. Previously, both methods accepted both formats in
  violation of the STAC API spec.

### Changed

- Upgrade to Node 14
- Elasticsearch version update 7.9 -> 7.10
- Use Express for API routing
- Item and collection ingest operations will full replace an item with the same ID. Previously, partial-updates were being performed.
- Improvements to Elasticsearch field mappings
- PATCH /collections/:collectionId/items/:itemId now returns 204 No Content as succcess instead
  of 200 and the updated Item

### Removed

- Querying Items in a Collection by POST to /collections/:collectionId/items is
  no longer supported, as this is forbidden by the STAC API - Features
  conformance class because it conflicts with the Transaction Extension
